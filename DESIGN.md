## Libraries, tools & API's 

To visualize the results for the students [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) will be used.

For the translation activities, [Google Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstart-client-libraries#client-libraries-usage-java) will be used. This can be easily used in Java or Python and is obviously properly supported and documented.

[Material Design](https://material.io/design/) will be probably used everywhere.

For word definitions in English, the [Oxford Dictionary API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/) is used



**Additional parts**

Ultimately, I want a teacher to be able to create a quiz by simply taking a picture of the word list (or a set of Multiple Choice questions...etc.). However, this is out of the scope of this course so I am listing is as **additional**.

[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is used to for image processing.

**Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** is done using [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

Natural Language Processing is done using [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)

[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is used for analyzing text documents.
