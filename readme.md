The final project for Native App Studio.





### Option 1: Pee for Free

Remember last time you were visiting a different city and needed to go to the bathroom? Mostly you keep looking for a while and then find a Burger King and pay for it. 

With this app:

-  You can find locations nearby where you could go to the restroom. 
- You could earn points when you rate the locations 
- You could earn points by adding new places
- Using your points you can get special offers 



Than main target audience will be travelers. 

While the app contains restrooms you could add places to drink, special foods to buy and must do's. 

**Note 1: There are such apps; however, non of them if active in Europe (most in US) and they are for specific groupt like people with Crohn's disease.**

### Option 2: Studying app

When visiting several developing countries such as Brazil, Egypt and Tunisia, you notice a huge difference in the quality of education than in Amsterdam. Also a lot of students (high-school and university) don't own a laptop and only a smart phone. 

An app that could help there, is a studying app that has a teacher and student interface. 

Let's take a subject like math for example:

The app could generate specific problem based on an example and even generate step by step hints until you reach a solution. Take a look at the following example written in JavaScript
![Sample](https://github.com/artix15/Project-NAS/blob/master/math_counting_example.PNG)

A far more interesting subject is English (or any other foreign language). The teacher can choose a type of question and simple functionality to help teaching such a class includes:

- Multiple choice questions
- Revising words and translations
- Ordering several sentences

Then the interesting functionality can come from Natural Language Processing to automate much harder tasks such as check essays or typed answers.



**Note**: Several of the ideas exist separately; however, there is no app with a simple user interface for a teacher to create his own content and where students can be linked to teacher and automatically graded.

**Note 2:** Using Natural Language Processing to find typos and grammar mistakes is hard but doable, but using NLP to check whether the text makes sense content wise is and open problem and way out of the scope of this project.
