# day 2 (8 Jan)

**Goals**

- [x] **Draft the design document**

- [x] **Look for efficient prototyping tools** 
      I looked at [Google Prototyping Video's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMjozqJS44M&t=1s)
      â€‹
      Also, I found several tools to make prototypes easily (as see in second video) such as [Proto.io](https://proto.io/) and [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/ui-design-kits.html). I went for the second because it has UI kits such as [Material Design](https://material.io/) and can partially be converted in Android studio

- [x] **Make a first prototype**

      A very quick prototype has been made and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5YkaQjKWw0&feature=youtu.be) demonstrating the idea

- [x] **Get feedback on prototype**
      6 people gave feedback on my prototype. Main critical points were: it doesn't look good, the sidebar, it's cluttered and there are too many unnecessary option. 
      The book "***Don't make me think***" was recommended.



New hand drawn drafts for [teacher side](https://github.com/artix15/Project-NAS/blob/master/Prototypes/Zaker%20Adventure%20Prototype/Draft%20Teacher%20side.jpg) and [student side](https://github.com/artix15/Project-NAS/blob/master/Prototypes/Zaker%20Adventure%20Prototype/Draft%20student%20side.jpg) have been made.
