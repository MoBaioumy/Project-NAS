# Day 2 (8 Jan)

**Goals**

- [x] **Draft the design document**

- [x] **Look for efficient prototyping tools**: I looked at [Google Prototyping Video's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMjozqJS44M&t=1s). Also, I found several tools to make prototypes easily (as see in second video) such as [Proto.io](https://proto.io/) and [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/ui-design-kits.html). I went for the second because it has UI kits such as [Material Design](https://material.io/) and can partially be converted in Android studio

- [x] **Make a first prototype**: A very quick prototype has been made and a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5YkaQjKWw0&feature=youtu.be) demonstrating the idea

- [x] **Get feedback on prototype**
      6 people gave feedback on my prototype. Main critical points were: it doesn't look good, the sidebar, it's cluttered and there are too many unnecessary option. 
      The book "***Don't make me think***" was recommended.



New hand drawn drafts for [teacher side](https://github.com/artix15/Project-NAS/blob/master/Prototypes/Zaker%20Adventure%20Prototype/Draft%20Teacher%20side.jpg) and [student side](https://github.com/artix15/Project-NAS/blob/master/Prototypes/Zaker%20Adventure%20Prototype/Draft%20student%20side.jpg) have been made.



# Day 3 (9 Jan)

- [ ] **Fix GitHub problems**
      Unsolvable! 

- [x] **Read a summary of "*Don't make me think*"**
      The book is more about web design but a lot of the idea's are applicable here.

- [x] **Create a second proper prototype based on feedback and new draft**

Second prototype [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPi2C28WYpQ&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR1snFk3T4RJoFFlXDoGs7b4SqR7w5wlb-OdB_xoOOzI8z6aajFOlQEQEVU). 

To simplify the project: 

- I will only keep 2 sample users and no more.
- It will be only about **one subject** so as a student you only have quizzes instead of having several courses with quizzes for each course.



# Day 4 (10 Jan) 

- [x] Complete the ZAKER prototype by adding teacher functionality: [Video](https://youtu.be/h-DTupYigps). Feedback included that the teacher parts with more pleasing to look it since that background wasn't very cluttered and neat.

- [x] Get a basic overview in App Studio 

- [x] Start with the Image and Text Processing scripts




# Day 5 (11 Jan)

- [x] **Get feedback on the design**
      A feedback has been very positive so far and much better than the first prototype.
- [x] **Mentor Meeting and check that my project and proposal are all right.**
- [ ] ~~**Create the Zaker prototype UI interface in Android Studio**~~
      ~~The elements created in Photoshop can be imported as drawable.~~ Feedback was: the design looks good and fun but is not really about an educational app. So I decided to have a blank design for now and  focus on the functionality.
- [x] **Finish the Zaker Prototype in App studio (all the activities, navigation and test functionality)**
      Good progress but not finished


I have decided to leave out the following for the Alpha Version:

- Any graphics and UI creation until the functionality is done properly. Not only does it cost time, but feedback about it hasn't been very positive
- I will have 3 sample quizzes hardcoded for the teacher. In the future it will be data coming from Python scripts that processed images.
- No API's will be used for now. The teacher will save questions for the quizzes to the Data Base and the student will read them from there.

# Day 6 (14 Jan)

- [x] **Continue on the Zaker Prototype in App studio (all the activities, navigation and test functionality)**

- [x] **Get [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) to work properly**: [Screenshot of the test](https://github.com/artix15/Project-NAS/blob/master/Documentation/BasicLineChart.png)

- [x] **Create test chart for Student Progress**

- [x] **Question class and adapter for the quizzes**

- [x] **Create Database, save quizzes and read from it**

      â€‹


# Day 7 (15 Jan)

- [x] **Create 3 sample quizzes a teacher can add**
- [x] **Display word list after being added**
- [x] **Allow the quizzes to be sent to the data base and to read them **
- [x] **On the student side, read the words from the data base**
- [x] **Create a simple True/False quiz with the words**




# Day 8, 9 (16, 17 Jan)

Nothing new. The code from yesterday is still not working properly. 

Everything works now; however, from the student side you can't choose from different quizzes anymore, just answers the most recent questions added.
