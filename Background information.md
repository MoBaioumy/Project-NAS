The final project for Native App Studio.


### Studying app - Front end development of a Language learing app

When visiting several developing countries such as Brazil, Egypt and Tunisia, you notice a huge difference in the quality of education than in Amsterdam. Also a lot of students (high-school and university) don't own a laptop and only a smart phone. 

An app that could help there, is a studying app that has a teacher and student interface. 

Let's take a subject like math for example:

The app could generate specific problem based on an example and even generate step by step hints until you reach a solution. Take a look at the following example written in JavaScript
![Sample](https://github.com/artix15/Project-NAS/blob/master/math_counting_example.PNG)

A far more interesting subject is English (or any other foreign language). The teacher can choose a type of question and simple functionality to help teaching such a class includes:

- Multiple choice questions
- Revising words and translations
- Ordering several sentences

Then the interesting functionality can come from Natural Language Processing to automate much harder tasks such as check essays or typed answers.



**Note**: Several of the ideas exist separately; however, there is no app with a simple user interface for a teacher to create his own content and where students can be linked to teacher and automatically graded.

**Note 2:** Using Natural Language Processing to find typos and grammar mistakes is hard but doable, but using NLP to check whether the text makes sense content wise is and open problem and way out of the scope of this project.
