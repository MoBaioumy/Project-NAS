The final project for Native App Studio.


### Studying app - Front end development of a Language learing app

Motivation and background behind this idea can be found [here](https://github.com/artix15/Project-NAS/blob/master/Background%20information.md).



This app is to enable classrooms in developing counties to be more effective by providing a set of powerful tools to help both teachers and students in a very user-friendly app.

### Teacher perspective 

For teachers it is hard to digitalize study material and practice questions themselves since they don't have access too good computers and are generally not good at using them. Not to mention that fact that is takes a lot of time. Consider an apps that allow you to enter words and the translation and creates games like flash cards for the students. **In an English class in just one year, this could mean typing about 1400+ words.**

Having a general database for all teacher also doesn't work since every school and teacher can vary their topic and thus the order and content is often different. However, they often have notes they created for the students to memorize words from and booklets with question (such as Multiple Choice) they collected from several sources. Tools to make digitalizing these would be game changing for them.

This app should allow them to create question and teaching material as easily as taking a picture of that booklet. With a nice user interface they can edit entries, add them of delete them. For a specific class a code will be generated so that student can register for their class.

**For the class, a teacher should be able to see progress, set up homework with expiring dates and see the most common mistakes so he/she can focus on them next time.**



### Students perspective

A student can join a class created by a teacher. From that he get access to timed homework set by his teacher and practice material on the topic. The method will be to **"Teach for Mastery"**. So a student will remain in a section until he can properly answer all types of questions in that section.
